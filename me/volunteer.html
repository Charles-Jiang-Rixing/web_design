            <p>Last summer, I conducted a one-week field research in Nuanshui village, Gansu Province, China. There, I interviewed several villagers about their living conditions and the environmental pollution problem. Finally, I co-authored and published an <a href="https://chinaglobaldialogue.com/2022/07/28/甘肃省暖水村化肥使用现状/">investigative article</a> about how fertilizer usage might potentially do harm to the local environment. I also created an <a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/暖水村/61862298?fr=ge_ala">online encyclopedia entry</a> for the village to gain it more public attention.</p>

            <p>This year, I spent four months teaching students from an underprivileged area in Northwestern China. Some of them were about my age, and we were more like friends instead of teacher and students. This was indeed an unforgettable experience.</p>
